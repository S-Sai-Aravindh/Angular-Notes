*Angular : 
            -it is a javascript framework
            -it provide designing and development platform for creating single page application
            -latest version is 18
            -angular is developed and maintain by google


S/W : required : 
    - node.js : node --version
    - ts : tsc -v
    - angular : ng --version


-angular work on component
-component : it is a partial part of angular project
             -it contain code for angular project
             -it can be any part of project

    -in angular root component name is app 


*how to create component in angular
ng generate component componentName
ng g c componentName

-when we create component in angular it generate four file
 html , css , ts , spec.ts 

 how to get output of individual component
    -go to component ts file and copy its selector name and write as tag where you want


*databinding : getting or accessing data from one file to another file in same component
1. interpolation {{}} : in send data from ts file => html file
2. property binding[] : in this we set attribute(property) values ts=>html 
3. event binding () : in this we send data from html file to ts file
4. two-way binding [()] : in this we can send data from ts <=> html
                          - to perform two-way databinding we have ngmodel directory but ngmodel directory is not a part of core angular module it is a part of formsModule , for this first we to import formsModule in component.ts file import array  


Task 1 : create comp with toggleimgs in which on click have to toggle images
Task 2 : toggleimgs with four buttons 


*directive in angular 
-it is use to change appearance and behavior as well as perform DOM manipulation in angular

there are 3 types of directive
1. Structural directive : it is use to perform dom manipulation in angular 
                          - Structural directive denoted by *
                          - Structural directives are *ngIf , *ngFor , *ngSwitchCase
                          - we can apply one directive at a time to single element
                          - it is part of common module for this first we have to import common in component.  
        -ng template : display out on the basis of condition
2. attribute directive : it is use to change appearance and behavior of DOM 
        -ngStyle : it is use to apply style property on the basis of condition
        -ngclass : it is use to apply css class on the basis of condition
        -ngModel : it is use to perform two - way binding
3. custome directive : directive created by developer



<div [ngSwitch]="myCourse">
    <div *ngSwitchCase="'React'">You have selected React</div>
    <div *ngSwitchCase="'Angular'">You have selected Angular</div>
    <div *ngSwitchCase="'DotNet'">You have selected Dotnet</div>
</div>

"myCourse" => inside only  " ? " is called as variable

"'React'" , "'Angular'" , "'DotNet'" => inside " ' ? ' " tells that it is a value


component interaction : 
    accessing data from parent component to child component

    -input() decorator : it is use to send data from parent to child component
    -output() decorator  : it is use to send data from child to parent component


*pipes : 
    -it is use to transform  property value without changing its original value 
    -it is denoted by | sign 
    -there are 3 types of pipes in angular
        1. inbuilt pipes  : pipe created by developer
        2. custom pipes : pipe create by developer for particular use
        3. thirdparty pipes : pipes already developed by third party vendor , first we have to install it and then use it.

mypipes

2. custom pipes 
    - ng generate pipe pipename 

    npx ng generate pipe shared/custompipe/cube


    ng g c mypipes

task: create one custom pipe with name sqauare which will return the square of any number.

*how to bootstrap in angular
step1 : npm i bootstrap
step2 : go to angular.json file and in its style array import its path
step3: restart angular project


layout folder
Nav,pagenotfound,maindashboard,footer,login
ng g c layout/Nav

froms folder
angform,utdf,rtf
ng g c forms/angform

*routing in Angular : 
-navigation of component
-to dispaly component output or navigating componently using routing in angular for it we write code in app.routes.ts.file
-

1.nameing routing
2.default routing
3.re-direct routing
4.parameterize routing
5.child routing
6.wild-card routing



==============================================================================================

    Day 13

    angular.io (For more reference)

    To perform routing , navigating in angular use routerLink property with a tag in html

    *angular form :
     - there are two types of forms
     1. UTDF(user template driven form):
        - when we have create simple form validation in that case we use it
        - to perform validation we have to use ngModel directory with input element
        - in this ngForm directorywill hold data of all input element in it

     2. RTF(Reactive Template form):
        - when we have to write complete logic to perform form validation in that case we use it 
        - to use rtf form validation first we have to import ReactiveFormModule from FormsModule in component
        - in rtf we write form validation code in ts file
        - in this we use mainly two classes
            1. FormGroup : it will hold information of all input element
            2. FormControl : it will hold information of individual input element

values on { ? } they are called as objects seperated by ,(Comma)



*service in angular
-in angular service is special class with extra power.
-it is use for multiple uses
1.to share data with multiple component.
2.we can implement bussiness logic in it.
3.we can perfoman external communication(database connection)

*how to create service
ng g service serviceName

ng g service shared/service/itemsservice
ng g service shared/service/dbservice

*how to access data from service into angular component
-if you want to service data into angular for this firt we have import service in component ts file and create instance of service class.


*REST Fake API

CRUD

cd src/app/shared/database

npx json-server --watch -p 8000 db.json


*How to make api request from angular to server
-to send request from angular service to server for this we have create instance of HttpClient class in service , but HttpClient class is not part of core angular it is part of HTTPClientModule so first we have to import provideHttp

Day 14


Concurrently 

1. npm i -g Concurrently
2. package.json => in script part => 
                
                "json-server":"cd src/app/shared/database && json-server --watch -p 8000 db.json"
                "start-dev":"npx concurrently \"ng serve\"\"npm run json-server\"",

                "json-server": "cd src/app/shared/database && json-server --watch -p 8000 db.json",
    "start-dev": "npx concurrently \"ng serve\" \"npm run json-server\"",



npm install concurrently --save-dev
